# SterCinemasUApi

## Description

A completely unofficial api that retrieves - in a dummy way - the schedule for available movies at the www.stercinemas.gr cinema.

## About

+ The `fetch.rb` file reads the home page and gets the schedule of the html.
+ The `index.rb` starts [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

## Disclaimer

I don't own any of the cinema's info. Built for fun, it's not official, might - sometime - something change on the cinema's website and break the script. Do what you want with it.
