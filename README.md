# SterCinemasUApi

## Description

A completely unofficial api that retrieves - in a dummy way - the schedule for available movies at the www.stercinemas.gr cinema.

+ The `fetch.rb` file reads html pages and gets the schedule and coming-soon movies out of them
+ The `index.rb` file starts [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).
+ You can [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Disclaimer

I don't own any of the cinema's info. Built for fun, it's not official, might - sometime - something change on the cinema's website and break the script. Do what you want with it.
